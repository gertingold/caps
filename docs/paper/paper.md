# Summary


In conclusion, ``libcasimir`` has the following features:

 - Computation of the free energy for aspect ratios used in real experiments
 - Computation of the free energy in the high-temperature limit for perfect reflectors, and metals described by the Drude or plasma model
 - Full support for perfect reflectors, metals described by the Drude and plasma model, and generic materials described by a user-defined dielectric function
 - Computation of the free energy at zero temperature for perfect reflectors in the plane-cylinder geometry
 - Support for parallelization using MPI


``libcasimir`` is released under the GPLv2 license.
