libcasimir implements the numerics for the Casimir effect in the plane-sphere
geometry for arbitrary materials at zero and finite temperature using the
scattering approach.

This document describes the API of the libcasimir library. The compilation of
the software and the usage of the programs are described in the user manual
(manual.pdf).
